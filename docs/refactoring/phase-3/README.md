# 🧪 Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure

## 📋 Overview
Phase 3 establishes comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure code quality and prevent regressions during future refactoring.

**Duration:** 2-3 weeks  
**Risk Level:** 🟢 Low  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 Complete  

## 🎯 Goals
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- Write comprehensive tests for utilities and components
- Implement integration testing for key user flows
- Establish testing standards and patterns
- Create CI/CD testing pipeline

## 📁 Phase Structure

├── 03-component-testing.md     # Test core components
└── 04-integration-testing.md   # Test user workflows
```

## 🔄 Execution Order
1. **Test Setup** - Install and configure testing tools
2. **Utility Testing** - Test all functions in lib/ directory
3. **Component Testing** - Test reusable and core components
4. **Integration Testing** - Test complete user workflows

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] >80% test coverage for utility functions
- [ ] >60% test coverage for components
- [ ] Key user flows have integration tests
- [ ] Testing runs automatically in CI/CD
- [ ] Test documentation and standards established
- [ ] Regression prevention through comprehensive tests

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- **Test Setup:** 0/5 tasks complete
- **Utility Testing:** 0/5 tasks complete
- **Component Testing:** 0/5 tasks complete
- **Integration Testing:** 0/5 tasks complete

**Phase 3 Total:** 0/20 tasks complete (0%)

## 🚨 Critical Notes
- **DO NOT** break existing functionality while adding tests
- **FOCUS** on testing business logic and user interactions
- **PRIORITIZE** tests for complex components and workflows
- **ENSURE** tests are maintainable and reliable
