```

## 🔄 Execution Order
1. **Bundle Analysis** - Analyze current bundle and implement code splitting
2. **Image Optimization** - Optimize images and implement progressive loading
3. **CSS Performance** - Optimize CSS delivery and remove unused styles
4. **Monitoring** - Add performance monitoring and alerts

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [ ] Bundle size reduced by 15-20%
- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores improved
- [ ] Images load progressively with proper optimization
- [ ] CSS performance optimized
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard active
- [ ] No functionality or visual regressions

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- **Bundle Analysis:** 0/5 tasks complete
- **Image Optimization:** 0/5 tasks complete
- **CSS Performance:** 0/5 tasks complete
- **Monitoring:** 0/5 tasks complete

**Phase 4 Total:** 0/20 tasks complete (0%)

## 🚨 Critical Notes
- **MEASURE** performance before and after changes
- **PRESERVE** exact visual appearance during optimizations
- **TEST** on various devices and network conditions
- **MONITOR** real user performance metrics
